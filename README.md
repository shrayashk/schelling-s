# schelling-s
A visualization of Schelling's Model of Segregation.
Uses matplotlib, networkx and random libraries. The script first plots a 10x10 grid of red nodes representing the initial state of all occupants being "satisfied" with their neighbours. Then the script generates another plot where in we have 3 varieties of neighbours represented by colors (namely red, green and white). Taking the parameter "t" as the number of neighbours needed to be of the same color to saitsfy a given node and fixing it as 3 for our script, the script generates a 3rd plot after it reaches a state where the nodes have been segregated into communities of the same color and each node has "t" number of neighbors.
